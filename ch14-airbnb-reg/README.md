Two key information re using these scripts

## Data

There is two version of the clean data after we discovered some bugs in the raw to clean cleaning files (hosted at the data repo on osf.io.) We'll hope to sort it out later. 

The scripts use `airbnb/clean/airbnb_london_cleaned_book.csv`. 

## Python vs R

There will be some differences in results. The python code is still in development, as we try figure out these differences.
