## How to use
On our website, detailed presentation of how to set up libraries, get data and code. 

[Overview of data and code](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/data-and-code/)

Regular releases happening, `v1.0.0` expected in July. 

## Get data
Data is hosted on OSF.io

## Status (06 May, 2021)
1. **R** -- All codes ready. Used for graphs in textbook. Minor edits, bug fixes happening, `renv` coming soon.
2. **Stata** -- All codes ready. In the lack of machine learning capabilities, no code for chapters 15,16,17, some limitations for chapter 18. Minor edits happening.
3. **Python**  -- Under preparation. Chapters 01-11 ready, chapters 12-24 are under development, should be ready by summer 2021. `pip install requirements.txt` ready. 

## Organization
1. Each case study has a separate folder.
2. Within case study folders, codes in different languages are simply stored together. 
3. Data should be downloaded and stored in a separate folder. 

## Code language versions
1. **R** -- We used R 4.0.2. 
2. **Stata** -- We used version 15, allmost all code should work in version 13 up.
3. **Python** -- We used Python 3.6.0.

## Found an error or have a suggestion?
Awesome, we know there may be errors. Or just much better ways to do a procedure.

To make a suggestion, please open a `github issue` here with a title containing the case study name. Cheers!
